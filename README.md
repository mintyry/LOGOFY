# LOGOFY

## Description üì∞

This application generates an SVG logo from the user's answers to the prompted questions.

I was motivated to make this app because it saves time and money; instead of hiring a graphic designer to make a simple logo, the user can now just generate one in seconds! This app solves the problem of having to use/buy any design software to manually create shapes, fill in colors, and add text. Answering a simple prompt of questions will do all the work!  

In making this app, I learned how to make and run tests. I also learned why it is valuable to use destructuring (in this case, to access the individual shape classes), and this project allowed me to practice more of the syntax used with inquirer. Additionally, I learned more about SVG images, and how to plot points to make specific shapes.

Please [watch this video](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/6igrVNtyBE32Ahj9Yeoj) for a walkthrough of how to use LOGOFY.

The user will be prompted with a short series of questions about their logo:  
- What text will it contain?  
- What color will the text be?  
- What shape it will be?  
- What color will the shape be?  

Then either a triangle, circle, or square logo will be generated as in the following example result images:
